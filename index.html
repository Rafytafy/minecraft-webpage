    <h1 class="text-center">Minecraft Server</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        We created a dedicated minecraft server using an ubuntu instance on google cloud. We both enjoy playing minecraft and wanted a way to play on our own server. 
        This server can host up to 20 people so we can get all our friends on the server to play. This server has 4 gigabytes of dedicated ram. It runs using spigot,
        a service used to implement plugins. Multiple plugins were implemented and used in order to make the game more fun. Whitelisting was also added to add security and avoid
        unwanted players on our server.
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            During the summer we played a lot of Minecraft and put in some hours into that game. We planned on taking Sys Admin together and when we were given
            the oppurtunity to create any service we wanted to we immediately decided to create a Minecraft Server. After the class is over we plan on expanding this
            to include more mods and features. Our goal is to have a server for us and our friends to play on.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>What is the service?</h3>
            <h3>How to implement the service</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>VM configuration/Firewall:</h4>
                <p>To implement this service we used a ubuntu image (18.04 LTS). The reasoning was because a lot of the guides used an ubuntu image to create 
                    the server. In order to run the game properly we needed at least 1GB of RAM for the service to run properly accoring to the minecraft docs. 
                    For the machine configuration we used an E2 series and the type was a e2-medium. The system has 4 GB of RAM which was plenty for our service.
                    After configuring the service i named the server "minecraft-server"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google cloud by default rejects any traffic comming in that is outside of the network. So I had to create a firewall rule called minecraft-rule 
                    so that it allows traffic to be directed to the minecraft server. After creating the rule I had to apply it to minecraft-server.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Server configuration</h4>
                <p>
                    After updating the server using <strong>sudo apt update</strong> I had to install java and screen to the server running <strong>sudo apt install screen</strong>
                    and <strong>sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless</strong>. Screen allows an admin to create a terminal session that is detached. Without it the session will end
                    if you close the terminal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default minecraft runs off of port 25565 so I had to open that port on the machine. I ran <strong>sudo ufw allow 25565</strong> and used
                    this <a href="https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">service</a> to test if the port is open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next I had to create a new user in this system call <strong>mc</strong>. <strong>mc's</strong> home direcotry holds all of files that is used to launch the service.
                    Within the <strong>mc</strong> directory I used <strong>wget</strong> to retrieve the lastest version of minecraft from minecraft's main website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After downloading minecraft I used <strong>screen</strong> which created a detached terminal session.  Next I ran the minecraft using <strong>java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar 
                    server.jar nogui</strong>. This falled to execute because we need to accept the terms and conditions of the eula.txt file that was created when the command ran. 
                    Within that file I had to set a variable to true in order for the java command to run properly. Now I ran <strong>java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar 
                    server.jar nogui</strong> again and this time the service is up and running.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    After the intial server was created, we wanted to implement plugins in order to make the server more fun. We used spigot, which is a service created to easily add plugins to minecraft
                    servers. We downloaded spigot from their website and put it in the <strong>mc</strong> home directory. Then, we created a bash script named <strong>start.sh</strong> to run the server
                    more efficently. The bash script contained the new command to run the server using spigot, <strong>java -Xms1G -Xmx4G -XX:+UseG1GC -jar spigot-1.16.4.jar nogui.</strong>
                    Running this command also creates a directory named <strong>plugins.</strong> We downloaded three basic plugins to start and put their .jar files in the <strong>plugins</strong> directory. 
                    The server ran successfully with these plugins installed, and each plugin works successfully.

            I created an intial verison of the server on an ubuntu VM using VirtualBox. This was then taken and finialized on the google cloud server. I created a bash script, <strong>start.sh</strong> 
            for the server in order to run the server faster each time. I also added multiple plugins using spigot, a service that is used to run plugins on minecraft servers. Finally, I added whitelisting  
            to the server in order to keep the server secure and only allow players we want on the server.

                I was responsible for the VM configuration, firewall and server set up.
